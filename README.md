Update (June 2023): I am archiving this repository, as there are certainly no future plans to work on this project, but I am unsure if the other contributors would like it to remain public access or not. Therefore, I will stick with the status-quo there.

This project was for a Georgia Tech class back in Fall 2019 - certainly don't use it as a reference for any future projects or for any of the contributors' modern programming and design skills.

As this repo has been public since it's inception and completion, I am not aware of any academic integrity issues leaving this up. But feel free to contact me (James) if this needs to be privatized.
